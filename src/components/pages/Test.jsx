</span>
<hr/>
<p style={{textAlign:"justify" ,fontSize:'14px'}} className='p-2'> <b>Declarative Schema</b> is relatively new feature introduced in Magento 2.3 and is a new way to make changes to the database.<br/>

This new approach allows us to declare the final state of the database in an XML file (db_schema.xml) and the system automatically adjusts to it. Furthermore, when we uninstall the module, data will be deleted.
<br/>
<br/>
This replaces the use of various PHP classes like InstallSchema, UpgradeSchema, InstallData and UpgradeData.
